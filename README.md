### 
I am a 3rd year student at the University of Cincinnati working on getting a BS in Computer Engineering and a MEng in Computer Science! I have worked 2 co-op rotations with GE Appliances on the Wall Oven and the Commercial AC software teams. Most of my experience is in C, Lua, and C++, but I have also worked with Python and Matlab.
